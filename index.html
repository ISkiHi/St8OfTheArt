      <p>Hi, Kenny here. This is my portfolio. I'm an aspiring game developer, fresh out of university. My weapons of choice are Unreal Engine 5 (BP & C++) & Unity. Mainly focused
      on game programming, but open to working in many different game development roles. Also, I'm interested in anything videography, and photography. My main goals are to make a 
      variety of games, and become a 'Jack of All Trades' within the gaming, and media industry.</p>
