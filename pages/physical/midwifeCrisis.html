        <p>
            During October 2023, me and three other game designers were tasked to make a physical escape room game, which would fit on a small table
            within two weeks. This game was made by a four person team, and was finished within two weeks. My contributions included project management,
            idea generation, music & SFX editing, flowcharts, and video editing.
