      <p>
          Melancholia is a passion project me & James Kurtzman are working on. My contributions include animation, audio/game programming, level design, sound design, texture artist,
          and UI/UX design. This game is being made with Unity.
      </p>
      <p>
          Note: This is an extremely early build which includes placeholder assets, and is currently missing features. Melacholia will be continously worked on until release,
          and will be accessible here for a limited time only.
