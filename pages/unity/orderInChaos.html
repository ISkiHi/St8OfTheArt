        Order in Chaos is a 3D Virtual Reality game, where players start off in their own apartment, realising that the chaos and mess within their studio is giving them a 
        strange feeling of anxiety. Slowly, players decide to start tidying up and organise their room, closet, and bathroom by following their own to-do list. However, they 
        only have limited time to pull themselves together and create order in a chaotic room.
