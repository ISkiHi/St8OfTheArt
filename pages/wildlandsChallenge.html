      <p>
          During, January 2022, I was tasked with making a 2D level design which would fit in the game 'Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands' which I finished during March 2022. After, I was then tasked with blocking
          out the 2D layout in 3D whilst utilising basic geometry with minimal marketplace assets used. Enemies were represented with red mannequins, with no AI movement (which was not required). This project 
          was made in Unreal Engine 4, and was finished during May 2022.
