      <p>
          During September 2022, I was tasked to make a game with the theme of creation and destruction, which was targeted at an audience between the ages of 4-12, and has an
          educational element. Broken Records is a third person, musical themed game where the player must complete tasks to find all 'broken records'. These tasks include, finding a 
          guitar, completing a long sprint, answering educational questions based on rhymes, and decorating the home base. The player can collect disks to purchase upgrades, or 
          destroy walls to unlock other areas. Broken Records was made with Unreal Engine 5, and was finished during November 2022.
