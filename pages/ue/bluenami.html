      <p>
          During September 2022, I was tasked to make a game with a 3-bit colour scheme, and an input that has two different mechanics. Bluenami is an endless third person 
          shooter game. Each level consists of eight, sixteen or twenty-four enemies the player must kill to get to the next level. After every three levels, either the enemies 
          damage, health or speed will be upgraded, or the players time will be decreased by thirty seconds to increase the games difficulty. However, to counteract this, 
          after each level, the player can upgrade their ammo, damage, health, magazine, speed and time. Points are earned through each kill. Also, the special bar gradually 
          fills after each kill. Assuming the player has lost health, the player can use a partially filled special bar to regain their health, or the player can use a 
          filled special bar to kill all spawned enemies with a special bluenami attack. The game ends when the player is killed. I made this game in Unreal
          Engine 5 and finished the game during January 2023.
