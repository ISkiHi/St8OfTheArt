      <p>
        During February 2023, I was tasked to make a game with a team of 5. The game world needed to react based on the players interactions. Plus, AI entities that interacted 
        with player were required. My interactions with the game build were the following:<br>
        - C++/BP Programming <br>
        - Pickups/Inventory <br>
        - AI Patrol/AI Chase <br>
        - HUD <br>
        - Main Menu/Options/Pause Menu <br>
        - Music/SFX Implementation <br>
        Sentient was finished during May 2023. Sentient was made on Unreal Engine 5.
